## Why ?

Recently, I stumbled upon
[this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/18u925v/i_made_a_tool_in_2_hours_it_made_me_1000_so_far)
where the OP says he made $1000 from his image compressor. He built it in 2
hours. After carefully analyzing the website, I figured it couldn't be too hard
to make my own.

Objectives were to build the **fastest** image compressor with:

- no upload nor sign up
- no images limit
- no file size limit
- a privacy-friendly approach

https://www.bulkcompress.photos is the result of my work.

## Getting started

Ensure `deno` is installed and run the following command:

```
deno task start
# or
make start
```

### Building the project

make build
```
